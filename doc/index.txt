== Support and coverage ==
There are currently around 70 packages. There are both cross and native
toolchains. The cross toolchain requires a Linux system with a 64bit kernel
(not userspace).

.1 Windows files
This section provides 54 non-toolchain packages; they are sufficient to build
GTK+ and EFL applications, several network components and GCC itself.

.2 Cross-toolchain

GCC 4.8.2 (C, C++, ObjC), Mingw-w64 3.1.0

.3 Linux supplements

Additional tools for builds which cannot bootstrap themselves.

It is also possible to get support through the
link:https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mingw-w64-public[Mingw-w64
mailing-list].

Bug reports are handled through the link:http://win-builds.org/bugs[Bug
tracker].

=== IRC channels ===

The `#mingw-w64` IRC channels on Freenode and OFTC are appropriate places for
win-builds-related discussions.

== Getting and running the system ==

=== From Windows (outside of MSYS or Cygwin) ===
Note that these don't change system settings nor setup shell tools (for now).
This means you need to install msys, msys2, cygwin or nothing if your IDE
doesn't need anything besides the toolchain. You also need to set variables
like %PATH% yourself.

Download and run
link:http://win-builds.org/@@VERSION@@/yypkg-@@VERSION@@.exe[yypkg-@@VERSION@@.exe].

[NOTE]
The toolchain will then be setup and can be used standalone or from an IDE.
The only settings needed is to set the PATH and PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR environment
variable to chose between the 32 bits and 64 bits toolchain:

* for 32 bits:
** prepend C:\win-builds-32\bin to PATH
** set PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR to C:\win-builds-32\lib\pkgconfig

* for 64 bits:
** prepend C:\win-builds-64\bin to PATH
** set PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR to C:\win-builds-64\lib64\pkgconfig

[NOTE]
The 64 bits toolchain requires a 64 bits host to run.

=== From Windows for MSYS or Cygwin ===
The how-to for use with MSYS or Cygwin is available on a link:msys-cygwin.html[dedicated page].

There are a couple known issues associated with Cygwin. Be sure to check <<Known_Issues>>.

=== From Linux 64b ===
The how-to for use with Linux is available on a link:linux.html[dedicated page].

// === Yypkg cheatsheet ===
// See "yypkg -help" for a quick reference and
// link:http://git.ocamlcore.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=yypkg/yypkg.git;a=blob;f=USAGE[yypkg's
// documentation] for a more complete documentation

==== Demo ====
In order to build the GTK+ Hello world, cd in the win-builds directory
and run (copy-paste) the following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo ./main.sh @@VERSION@@

cd root

cat << EOF > gtk_hello_world.c
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    GtkWidget *window;
    gtk_init (&argc, &argv);
    window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
    gtk_widget_show  (window);
    gtk_main ();
    return 0;
}
EOF

i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o gtk_hello_world.exe gtk_hello_world.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Update packages ===
Updating packages requires a few but simple steps. You need

* If you haven't kept the content of the .zip installation archive, download
  the archive again and extract it where you wish.
* Open a cmd.exe shell.
* Run `sherpa.exe -prefix C:/installation/path -update package_to_update`. An
  example is:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------
C:/win-builds-installer/sherpa.exe -prefix C:/win-builds-32 -update openssl
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are using Cygwin or MSYS, first change directory to the one which
contains sherpa.exe. In the case of Cygwin, you will have to provide a
Windows-style path which you can get with a command similar to `$(cygpath -m
/opt/windows_32)`.

[[Known_Issues]]
=== Known issues and work-arounds ===
* Graphical installer is being reworked and is not available yet.
* Windows XP/2k3 don't handle junctions and even hardlinks very well, making
  their removal by hand difficult.

=== Advanced usage: Build it yourself ===
Building everything yourself is not difficult nor time-consuming: a full
build is very easy to setup and takes a couple hours on an old machine
and one hour on a quad-core from 2 to 3 years ago. The documentation is
available on a separate page link:diy.html[doc-diy].

=== Advanced usage: Package yourself ===
It is fairly easy to create new packages: the usual way is to port existing
Slackware build scripts to yypkg and mingw with a few simple serch-and-replace
operations.

You first need to have an environment setup for building packages; this step
is described on the link:diy.html[doc-diy] page. Once you have it, have a look
at the link:packaging.html[packager documentation] page.
